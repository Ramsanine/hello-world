# hello-world
This is my first repository as I begin to learn to code.

My name is Ramsey, I like to play basketball and volleyball, and I am good at Math and Science.  I am looking forward to learning how to code.  My goal with coding is to learn and have fun with it and possibly make a career out of it if I have a passion for it.

I am currently living in a studio in Glen Park.  I recently moved here.  I like to play beach volleyball
on the weekends.  I am currently single and trying to do a carreer change.  Its tough,
but I think I am up for the task.
